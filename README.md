# Dotfiles

This dotfiles repo has one folder for each application that I want to configure. I am currently using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to symlink the files in the folder to the appropriate location in the home directory.

Scripts that automate the installing and configuring process are planned to be added.
