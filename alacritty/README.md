# Alacritty

Configuration files for [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty).

This is my terminal emulator of choice. I switched from iTerm2 because it's fast, clean, not bloated, and can be easily configured with a single file. It already comes with a lot of sensible defaults right out of the box so very little configuration is needed.

Some minor cons: not having built-in tab support. Also the lack of image previews, ligature, and emoji support afaik. None of these are bothering to me though.
