# Zed

Configuration files for [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed).

A backup code editor. Faster than VSCode. Slightly unstable (still under v1.0.0 yet) and some features like collaboration, assistant and chat cannot be removed completely. Would love to see it be able to replace the bloated VSCode in some ways in the future.
